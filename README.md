# JuliaTorch

Using PyTorch in Julia Language via PyCall.

## Requirement

* Julia 1.0+
* PyTorch 0.4+ with Python 3.5+ (Anaconda3 is recommended)
* [PyCall.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPy/PyCall.jl) 0.18.5+, the lower version may lead to memory leakage

## Roadmap

* [Linear Regression](https://github.com/boathit/JuliaTorch/blob/master/linearRegression.jl)
* [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/boathit/JuliaTorch/blob/master/logisticRegression.jl)
* [MLP](https://github.com/boathit/JuliaTorch/blob/master/mlp.jl)
* [Convolutional Neural Net](https://github.com/boathit/JuliaTorch/blob/master/convnet.jl)
* [Variational Auto-Encoder](https://github.com/boathit/JuliaTorch/blob/master/vae.jl)
